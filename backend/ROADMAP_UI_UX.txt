UI/UX Roadmap

Phase 1 – Preset Browsing & Editing Basics
- Add searchable/filterable preset list (tags, effect_type, popularity) sourced from presets.json and pyonfx_effects.json.
- Inline preset editing forms with validation (color pickers, sliders for numeric ranges using config metadata).
- Clear status/feedback: toast on save, inline error messages, preview load indicators.

Phase 2 – Preview Experience
- Live preview panel with controls: play/pause, seek, step-through words/sentences, seed toggle for deterministic effects.
- Quick knobs for effect_config (intensity/particle count/offsets) with immediate preview refresh.
- Side-by-side compare: current vs modified preset; visual diff option (image overlay/fade slider).

Phase 3 – Information Architecture & Layout
- Dedicated “Preset Details” drawer/page with: description, effect_type, config schema, sample GIF/ASS snippet, related presets.
- Tagging and grouping (e.g., Particles, Glitch, Karaoke, TikTok) with color-coded chips.
- Responsive layout: adaptive grid for presets on desktop, stacked cards with horizontal scroll on mobile.

Phase 4 – Visual Design & Theming
- Establish design tokens: typography scale, spacing, radii, shadows, color roles (bg/surface/primary/accent), and effect-specific accent colors.
- Light/Dark theme parity with accessible contrast; optional “neon” accent for preview controls.
- Consistent iconography for actions (edit/duplicate/delete/export/screenshot).

Phase 5 – Creation & Duplication Flows
- “Duplicate preset” and “Save as new” flows that prefill from an existing preset; allow renaming and quick tag assignment.
- Wizard for new preset: choose base effect_type, pick colors/font, tweak key params, preview, save.
- Bulk operations: multi-select delete/archive; import/export JSON for sharing.

Phase 6 – QA & Guardrails
- Inline validation based on pyonfx_effects.json schema (min/max/default) with helper text.
- Warning banners for heavy presets (particle_count, blur) with suggested caps.
- Fallback handling: if an effect_type is unsupported/missing, show clear error and a fallback preview.

Phase 7 – Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for preset grid/list and form controls; focus states and shortcuts (e.g., space to play/pause preview).
- ARIA labels on controls; color pickers with textual input; tooltips for icons.
- Ensure preview color choices meet contrast guidelines where applicable.

Phase 8 – Observability & Feedback
- Capture UI errors to a client-side log; optional user feedback form tied to a preset (e.g., “effect looks off”).
- Lightweight performance metrics: preview render time, API latency.
- Surfacing most-used presets and recently edited presets on the landing/dashboard.

Phase 9 – Nice-to-Haves
- Animated transitions for preset cards (hover/selection), micro-interactions on sliders/switches.
- Theme presets (colorways) tied to effect categories to make the gallery visually diverse.
- Timeline scrubber overlay to show word timings and active segments during preview.
