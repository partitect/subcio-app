Reminder for continuing PyonFX porting

What’s done:
- presets.json externalized and main.py loads/saves it.
- pyonfx_effects.json externalized and get_pyonfx_effects reads from it.
- PyonFXRenderer supports many effect_types already: fire_storm, cyber_glitch, bubble_floral, thunder_strike, rainbow_wave, earthquake_shake, horror_creepy, luxury_gold, comic_book, pulse, colorful, ghost_star, matrix_rain, electric_shock, smoke_trail, pixel_glitch, neon_sign, fade_in_out, slide_up, zoom_burst, bounce_in, tiktok_yellow_box.
- presets.json updated with effect_type/effect_config for most of these.

Pending/To port (render_engine presets still without effect_type):
- falling-heart -> FallingHeartEffect
- thunder-storm -> ThunderStormEffect (complex: clouds, flashes, bolts, sparks, rain, flash overlay)
- ice-crystal -> IceCrystalEffect (frozen layers, shards, snowflakes)
- cosmic-stars -> CosmicStarsEffect (cosmic glow, orbiting stars, stardust, nebula, shooting stars)
- ocean-wave -> OceanWaveEffect (water glow, wavy text, particles, bubbles, foam)
- butterfly-dance -> ButterflyDanceEffect (flowers, butterflies, petals, breeze)
- Others in presets.json missing effect_type: neon-pulse, kinetic-bounce, cinematic-blur, typewriter-pro, word-pop, retro-arcade, news-ticker, tiktok-group, 3d-spin, shear-force, double-shadow, karaoke-classic, tiktok-box-group, sakura-dream, phoenix-flames, welcome-my-life, dynamic-highlight, karaoke-pro, karaoke-sentence, mademyday.

Where to insert code:
- backend/styles/effects/pyonfx_effects.py currently ends after _render_pulse and _build_effect_tags; new render functions must be inserted before _build_effect_tags.
- Effect class stubs already added for falling_heart, thunder_storm, ice_crystal, cosmic_stars, ocean_wave, butterfly_dance at the top; need to implement _render_* for each.
- main.py PyonFX dispatch list includes these effect_type names; make sure to add to presets.json and pyonfx_effects.json metadata when implemented.

Artifacts in git status:
- M backend/main.py
- M backend/styles/effects/pyonfx_effects.py
- ?? backend/presets.json (new tracked)
- ?? backend/pyonfx_effects.json (new tracked)
- ?? backend/render_engine_backup.py (untouched by this work)

Suggested next step when resuming:
- Implement _render_falling_heart, _render_thunder_storm, _render_ice_crystal, _render_cosmic_stars, _render_ocean_wave, _render_butterfly_dance inside pyonfx_effects.py (place them above _build_effect_tags).
- Update presets.json effect_type/effect_config for remaining presets once their renderers exist.
- Update pyonfx_effects.json metadata entries for new effects (names/descriptions/config).
